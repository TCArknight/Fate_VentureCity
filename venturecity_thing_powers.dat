You may communicate with favored animals of this type as if they were human NPCs, although their understanding of the world is limited. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to Rapport when asking an animal of that type to do something for you.{br}{br}&quot;Type&quot; is an intentionally broad category. It doesn’t necessarily line up with a taxonomic category, but rather how useful the animal is and how often you’ll see it. Only multicellular animals can be controlled; bacteria are too simple to order around. Some types of animals you might control include fish, birds, insects, rodents, and dogs.{br}{br}{b}Common Power Synergies{/b}{br}{b}Super Abilities:{/b} You can speak for animals and, in return, they have trained you, pushing you to the upper limits of human ability. You have Super Agility, Super Strength, Super Toughness, or Super Senses.{br}{br}{b}Influence:{/b} Humans are, after all, just another type of animal, albeit ones who are a little more complex to control." compset="Power" uniqueness="unique">

You might bring forth an elemental, or something mundane like a sidekick shows up to help out. When you take this power, create a creature with one aspect to describe it and one Good (+3) skill. Your creature has two physical and mental stress boxes, and it can take mild and moderate consequences. Your creature will dissipate or wander away at the end of the scene, clearing its consequences.{br}{br}Your summoned creature is not an NPC, but another character under your control. When your creature is active during a conflict, it acts on your turn. Both of you take a free movement, but only one of you can take an action.{br}{br}{b}Common Power Synergies{br}Animal Control:{/b} You can call forth hordes of animals when you want to, but one specific animal is your special companion, always by your side.{br}{br}{b}Projection:{/b} The creature you call forth is an elemental avatar of fire, frost, electricity, or shadow." compset="Power" uniqueness="unique">

Once you spend time interacting with someone, you can imitate them near-perfectly. Gain a +2 bonus to Deception to oppose others trying to see through your disguise.{br}{br}{b}Common Power Synergies{br}Illusion:{/b} You aren’t actually altering your face; you’re just projecting a disguise over it, using your mastery of illusions.{br}{br}{b}Shape Shifting:{/b} Altering your face and body is good practice for your fine detail work, but you can change your entire shape when you need to." compset="Power" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="pwrDuplic" name="Duplication" description="{i}You can be an entire team, all by yourself.{/i}{br}{br}Once per scene, you can create a copy of yourself up to one zone away. This copy has your aspects and skills, but it takes a -1 penalty to all rolls. The duplicate is not an NPC, but another character under your control. During a conflict, both you and your copy get a free movement, but only one of you can take an action. You may dismiss the copy at will, or it will fade away on its own at the end of the scene. Your duplicate has its own physical stress boxes and consequence slots for physical damage. If your duplicate would take mental stress, you take it instead.{br}{br}{b}Common Power Synergies{br}Teleportation:{/b} By creating a duplicate some distance away and then willing away your original body, your consciousness jumps into the spare body, effectively teleporting you. There are metaphysical concerns here, but you try not to think about them.{br}{br}{b}Energy Blast:{/b} You -- there’s no clean way to put this. You can try to create a copy of yourself inside someone else. It’s unsettling. But effectively it works like throwing a blast of energy at them." compset="Power" uniqueness="unique">

Additionally, you can contort your body into rough approximations of animals, objects, and tools, although your mass doesn’t change and you still very much look like yourself.{br}{br}{b}Common Power Synergies{br}Super Toughness:{/b} Your body is a shifting, inconsistent mass of vague stuff. It’s hard for it to get hurt in a meaningful way.{br}{br}{b}Disguise:{/b} With a little careful manipulation, you can reshape your face, body, and even voice into convincing facsimiles of someone else’s.{br}{br}{b}Natural Weapon:{/b} Your elastic arms can turn into blades, hammers, clubs -- all manner of built-in weaponry." compset="Power" uniqueness="unique">

Just by seeing a device, you can tell what it does, at least in general. In addition, you gain +MYVAL to Crafts when repairing or building complex devices.\n\n{b}Common Synergies{/b}\n{b}Super Gadgeteering:{/b} Virtually any power can become an ability that you have thanks to a gadget you have created. You might have jetpack-powered Flight, a device which lets you Phase through walls, or a ray to create energy Shields. Even though these powers come from devices, the devices only work because of your superhuman craft, so they can be affected as standard powers can by Power Amplification, Power Nullification, and other means.\n\n{b}Technology:{/b} Your mechanical aptitude is superior, but it’s not quite superhuman.

Against a named NPC or a PC, they may follow your order or take mental stress from the attack, their choice. Anyone you give a task to will try their best to accomplish it until they succeed or the scene ends, whichever comes first. The tasks you assign are short-term objectives, such as “Give me that gun,” or “Go away.” Because even the weakest-willed are driven by self-preservation, you cannot force someone to directly harm themself or put themself in an inevitably fatal position, such as jumping off a building, but you can force them to take riskier actions than they would like to.\n\n\n\n{b}Harm{/b} Medicine and poison are the same thing, really.

While the item you summon can have multiple parts—for instance, a sack of marbles—you can’t summon electronic gadgets, explosives, or items that require precise manufacturing, like firearms. You may only summon one item at a time, but you can summon as often as you’d like. Increase the opposition by +2 for every other item summoned by you in the scene.
